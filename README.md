# @rappstack/dev

rappstack (reactive app stack) development repo with submodules to all @rappstack repos

## Why no npm packages?

@rappstack/* packages are currently used as git submodules in a bun monorepo. This is to get some apps off the ground & deal with api churn. I'm developing several websites & apps using these submodules. Once the api churn subsides, then I will release npm packages.
